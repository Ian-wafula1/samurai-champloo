- Wield, buy, and sell various **Weapons** with different damage and durability.
- Accept **Quests** of varying difficulty, type, and rewards.
- Track quest **status** per samurai.
- Form and manage powerful **Clans** with dojo names and leaders.
- Challenge others to **Duels**, with winners determined by skill and gear.
